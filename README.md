#### **Snake**
Classic Snake game made in Python with Tkinter.

To run the Snake game:

1. `cd snake`

2. `python -m gui`

The game starts once the player presses **"Enter"**. The snake grows in length everytime it eats an ***apple***. Be reminded that the snake speeds up everytime it eats. The game ends once the snake hits the wall or eats itself.
